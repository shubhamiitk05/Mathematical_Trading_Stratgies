# Mathematical Trading Strategies

## About the Project
This repository contains the 8-week project offered by the Stamatics Society at IIT Kanpur. The following is a brief overview of the project and each of the covered assignments.

## Project Overview
During this project, we explored the basics of trading in finance, gained a strong understanding of technical tools and chart patterns used for formulating trading strategies, and delved into the mathematics behind them. Additionally, we learned about existing algorithmic strategies for profit-making in this domain. The ultimate goal was to develop our own unique trading strategy/hypothesis using the tools we acquired and statistically test its significance.

## Assignment Details:
### Assignment 1:
In this assignment, we learned about important techniques for evaluating investments, including Returns, Cumulative Returns, Max Drawdowns, the Sharpe Ratio, and the Sortino Ratio. We utilized the robust `yfinance` module in Python, which simplifies access to a wide variety of financial data. The implementation and results for this assignment can be found in the following files:
- [MTS_A1](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Mathematical-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Assignment%201/PriyanshuRajJindal(210787)/MTS-1_PRJ.ipynb): Contains the implementation for all the ratios and evaluating parameters mentioned above.
- [Evaluating_Parameters.pdf](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Mathematical-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Assignment%201/PriyanshuRajJindal(210787)/PRJ.pdf): Compiles the results of the evaluating parameters for the self-chosen Market equities and Stock indices.

### Assignment 2:
In this assignment, we focused on Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and we explored the advantages of EMA over SMA. We also gained an understanding of indicators such as Keltner Channel, Bollinger Bands, and MACD, and learned how to use them to create buy and sell signals. The implementation details for this assignment can be found in the following file:
- [MTS_A2](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Mathematical-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Assignment%202/210787_MTS_2.ipynb): Includes the implementation of correlation analysis, lead-lag relationship analysis, indicator coding, and signal generation.

### Assignment 3:
In this assignment, we explored different chart patterns, their significance, and their use in trading. The implementation details for detecting various chart patterns can be found in the following file:
- [MTS_A3](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Mathematical-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Assignment%203/MTS_3_210787_Priyanshu_Jindal.ipynb): Contains the code to detect ascending triangles, bear flags, cup and handles, head and shoulders, and rounding bottoms.

### Assignment 4:
The final assignment involved designing a trading strategy using indicators and chart patterns, as well as calculating evaluating parameters for the strategy. The implementation of the self-designed trading strategy, along with backtesting on the last 10 years of data and generating buy and sell signals, can be found in the following files:
- [MTS_A4](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Mathematical-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Assignment%204/210787_MTS_Final_Assignment.ipynb): Contains the implementation of the self-designed trading strategy.
- [Readme.pdf](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Mathematical-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Assignment%204/210787_Priyanshu_MTS_A4.pdf): Provides an overview of the strategy and its results.
